##Exercise

  Work on the gitTutorial folder, in order to simulate everything that was done within the Try Git Tutorial.
  The tutorial allow you to use some git commands but is skipping the creation and editing of the files, so 
  you are going to create/edit/delete the files following the tutorial steps using `git add [files]` and 
  `git commit -m "PLACE COMMIT NAME HERE"` in order to have a reference within the project per change.
  
###For example:
  
####Edit octocat.txt file
  1. Open octocat.txt file then create a change within the file, could be just add or erase a letter/paragraph ...
  2. Add changes to stage area `git add octocat.txt`
  3. Commit changes to the project `git commit -m "Octocat cat File edited"`
